## Personal Portfolio Website

![Portfolio Website Image](./assests/portfolio.png)


The website currently has placeholder images, texts, and links in the projects section. The projectcs are existing pages I developed in the past based on my skills set. The navigation section at the top will bring you to the various sections on the website. I added a skills section that I can gradually add to as I develop more skills.

I utilized Google Fonts for the fonts, and FontAwesome for the logos.
